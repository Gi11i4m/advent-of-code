# Advent of Code

My - mostly partial - attempts at the yearly [Advents of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

Each year has a new and hopefully better setup so instructions for running the solutions are in the respective yearly folders. 

So far I've been using TypeScript since I love TypeScript and it allows for pretty clean code in these kinds of challenges. Maybe I'll try a different language some year...
