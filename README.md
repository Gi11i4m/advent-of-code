# Advent of Code

My (mostly partial) attempts at the yearly [Advents of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

Each year has a new (hopefully better) setup so instructions for running are in the respective yearly folders. So far I've been using TypeScript since I love TypeScript and it allows for pretty clean code in these kinds of challenges. Maybe I'll try a different language some year...
