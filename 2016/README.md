My solutions to the 2016 Advent of Code programming problems.

Language = TypeScript.

## Execution

Set up the environment

> npm install

Set the day to execute

> npm config set advent-of-code:day ${day}

Execute the script for the configured day

> npm start

Watch code for the configured day for changes and show compiler output in the console

> npm run watch

## To do

- Re-write day1 in TypeScript
- Make day1 and day5 compatible with the npm start script
- Refactor day1 - day5
